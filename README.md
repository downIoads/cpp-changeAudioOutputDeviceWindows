# cpp-changeAudioOutputDeviceWindows
This tool lets change your windows audio output device by pressing 'End' key. It will cycle through all available audio outputs.

## Special thanks
Thank you [f1nality](https://github.com/f1nality/WindowsAudioOutput/tree/master) for providing the code that I slightly expanded to make it usuable in practise. I had to make two minor changes to get it running, then I added some code to make it user friendly.
