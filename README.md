# Change default audio device with the press of one key!
This tool lets change your windows audio output device by pressing 'End' key. It will cycle through all available audio outputs.

## Usage
Double click the .exe, then cycle through output devices by pressing the 'End' key. The cmd window does not have to be focussed for this to work! You probably should build the exe yourself, but I also put it here for those who are not devs.

## Special thanks
Thank you [f1nality](https://github.com/f1nality/WindowsAudioOutput/tree/master) for providing the code that I slightly expanded to make it usable in practise. I had to make two minor changes to get it running, then I added some code to make it user friendly.
